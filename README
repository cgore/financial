You probably want to play with the tvm-perpetuity-payment function mostly.

1. Install rlwrap (`apt-get install rlwrap` in Debian)

2. Install sbcl (`apt-get install sbcl` in Debian)

3. At the shell, type:
  rlwrap sbcl

4. In SBCL, type:
  (load "interest")

5. In SBCL, type:
  (tvm-perpetuity-payment 75000.00 1.05 12 30)

That will tell you how much you need to save each month to get back $75,000 per
year, assuming a 5% beat on inflation (not that irrationally exhuberant) for
the next 30 years.
